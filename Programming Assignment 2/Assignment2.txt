90.267	 C Programming	PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT #2	           2/25/14


The purpose of this lab assignment is to reinforce array processing, including the use of parallel arrays and the use of the else if statement.

Write a C program to determine letter grades for a class of up to 50 students. The input will be comprised of a file of student records comprised of two data items: a Student ID and a student Test Score. The end of file (end of data) is indicated by a record with a Student ID of 0 (zero). 

The program should first read in a student’s numeric id and a numeric test score for each student, into two corresponding arrays. After filling the two arrays the program should then determine each student’s letter grade and insert it into a corresponding third array.

Letter grades are to be determined as follows: 
         90 to 100 = A, 
         80 to 89 = B,
         70 to 79 = C,
         60 to 69 = D, 
         59 and below = F.   

After filling the array and test scores produce a report with appropriate headings showing the student’s ID, corresponding test score and letter grade.

After outputting the information requested above, produce a  report (output) showing the average test score; the number of students who had a test score above the average; the number of As, Bs, Cs, Ds and Fs; the student id, test score and letter grade of the student with the highest test score,

Use the following Data:
 *  ID , Score
 * 1653, 77
 * 1945, 72
 * 1020, 50
 * 1955, 92
 * 1030, 40
 * 1200, 72
 * 1500, 91
 * 1100, 90
 * 1900, 81
 * 1005, 95
 * 1790, 43
 * 1800, 85
 * 0   ,  0
